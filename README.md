# ft_printf
With this assignment, I had to recreate the <stdio.h> printf function.
The funtcion had to be able to handle the following formats:

%c - characters.
%s - strings.
%i - integers.
%u - unsigned integers.
%d - digits.
%p - pointers.
%x - lowercase hexadecimals.
%X - uppercase hexadecimals.

And of course the rest of the string.
